## 🌟 Features and Highlights

### 🧩 Business Problem
Marketing teams often run multiple ad campaigns across Facebook and Instagram but struggle to identify which platform, format, or audience segment performs best.  
Without consolidated tracking, **budget allocation becomes inefficient**, and conversion rates remain low despite high engagement.

---

### 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
To build an **interactive performance tracking dashboard** that:
- Monitors the full **marketing funnel** — from Impressions → Clicks → Purchases  
- Identifies top-performing **platforms, age groups, countries, and ad formats**  
- Enables **data-driven decisions** for ad budget optimization and audience targeting
